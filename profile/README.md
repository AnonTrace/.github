# AnonTrace Private Network
Here We Provide you with Anode and Cathode
What That Means?!ðŸ¤”
## Anode
We Provide You With Two different Anodes
it's our servers name for server build to be performant at any system and totally manageable with http interface
why you ask when we have traditional ssh servers?
 cause customizing traditional ssh servers may not be the best option for handling large set off users that have limitation on connection and want to be on different server some time(Load Balancer Scenario)
 1. Traditional Anode
 2. Unblock-able Anode

### Traditional Anode
it's normal ssh server that only works for Dynamic Port forwarding with argon2d as the password authentication
why we done this?!ðŸ¤”
'Cause we want to!
no seriously because it's much performant for organizing the users also performant for cpu and ram it can handle up to 10K users on a very small system(RAM 512MB, CPU 1GB)
